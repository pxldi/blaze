# Blaze engine
A graphics engine built with Vulkan and C++, designed for both 2D and 3D rendering.

## Overview

Blaze Engine is a personal project focused on exploring the capabilities of Vulkan while diving deep into modern C++ practices, shader development, and graphics programming. The engine serves as both a learning platform and a foundation for future graphics applications.

## Features
### Current

- Vulkan-based rendering pipeline

### Planned

- Support for both 2D and 3D scene rendering
- Network functionality for multiplayer capabilities
- Custom shader implementation
- Modern C++ architecture
- Advanced material system
- Physics integration
- Post-processing effects
- Scene graph optimization
- Asset management system

## Project Goals
This project serves multiple purposes:

- Deeper understanding of modern C++ practices and patterns
- Exploration of graphics programming concepts
- Learning shader development and implementation

## Contributing
This is currently a personal learning project, but feedback and suggestions are welcome through issues and discussions.
